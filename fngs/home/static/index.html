                    <p>The twenty first century has seen the rapid ascent of technology into everyday life. From high performance desktops, to smart phones, to super computers, many industries rely on the power and consistency of computing. Machine learning has furthered their applicability, as computers can be trained to recognize nearly invisible (to the human eye) patterns In the medical fields, however, many doctors continue to hinge on human power. The psychiatry field, for instance, continues to rely on psychological examinations almost exclusively when determining factors such as rate of development, mental disorder, and overall mental health in millions of patients each year. Standards of care and diagnosis vary widely between psychiatrists, and no quantiative tools exist to aid in their tasks. The brain, while superficially elegant, is an ovewhelmingly complex device consisting of billions of microscopic cells firing in unique patterns to create what we observe as thought. Imaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allow us to see these activation patterns in real time at a fine spatial resolution. Unfortunately, processing these graphs is a complex and expensive procedure. The initial investment in a processing pipeline may require hundreds of hours of labor to establish, and even using existing open source cutting edge tools requires a background in computer science and computer vision just to get the software installed and functioning properly; coupled with the extensive sets of options for processing, researchers looking to enter the computational neuroscience field may simply be barred by the learning curve to get involved. Through the Functional Neurodata Graphs Service, we hope to lower the barrier to entry of computational neuroscience. Our pipeline and quality control suite combine cutting edge existing open source software with many novel processing features, all wrapped in a simple-to-deploy docker container, so researchers will be able to ensure that they can easily and efficiently have their brain scans processed, along with easy to understand qualitative and quantitative metrics to ensure confidence in the outputs they receive. Together, the efforts of the Neurodata team combined with the latest generation of brain researchers will slowly unlock the mysteries of the brain, one connectome at a time.</p>
